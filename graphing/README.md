# Graphing Jupyter Notebooks

As part of our paper, we used two notebooks to produce the graphs found in our final manuscript

1. `processing.ipynb`, which was used to perform the pre-processing on the data log files produced by `scAtteR` and `scAtteR++`, and `Oakestra`. The script generates .csv files of the pre-processed log data to then be used by the following notebook.
2. `graphs.ipynb`, which was used to read the .csv files and then create the graphs
